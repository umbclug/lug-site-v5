# Events

## Installfest

Installfest is our outreach event where we introduce Linux to new users. We showcase different Linux distributions on several laptops and explain the basics of Linux and how to get involved with the club. Historically, we've helped attendees install Linux on their own devices during the event. For Fall 2025, we'll be giving out USB drives with Linux distributions pre-installed, so prospective users can install Linux themselves. Interested students are invited to our meeting later that night.

**Next Installfest:**  
**Date:** 9/17/2025  
**Time:** 12:00â€“2:00 PM  
**Location:** Commons Mainstreet

## LAN Night

LAN Night is a new event focused on local multiplayer gaming natively on Linux. We promote Linux gaming and demonstrate tools like Proton, Wine, and Lutris. We'll set up a simple LAN for everyone to connect and play together. The event is open to all students and alumni.
