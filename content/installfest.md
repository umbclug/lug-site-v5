# InstallFest 2025 – Linux Resources

Welcome! You’re probably here because you received a Linux USB drive from LUG.  

## What is Linux?
Linux is a free and open-source operating system. It’s secure, customizable, and used by everyone from casual users to Google, NASA, and UMBC servers.


## Why Use Linux?
- **Privacy:** Try Tails OS for secure, no-trace browsing.  
- **Revive Old Hardware:** Linux runs well on computers that can’t handle newer Windows.  
- **Windows 10 End of Life (October 14, 2025):** Linux keeps your device supported.  
- **Flexibility:** Customize appearance, software, and desktop environment.  


## About Your USB Drive
This USB is powered by [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/), which lets you choose from multiple operating systems when you boot:

- **Fedora KDE Plasma (Live)** – modern, polished desktop.  
- **Linux Mint Cinnamon (Live)** – beginner-friendly and familiar.  
- **Debian (Net Install)** – advanced users who want control.  
- **Tails (Live)** – privacy-focused system.  

### Interested in trying another version (distro) of Linux?
- Choose a distro that you are interested in trying: https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity
- Find and download an iso file
- Insert the USB drive.
- You will see two partitions, find the one with the iso files and a capacity of ~7.5gb
- The current drive is at capacity so delete some of the other distros. (Mint and Fedora take up the most space)
- Copy your downloaded iso to the root directory of the USB drive.


## How to Boot from USB
1. Insert the USB drive.  
2. Restart your computer.  
3. Enter the **boot menu** (usually by pressing `F12`, `Esc`, or `Del` at startup).  
4. Select the USB drive.  
5. Choose a system to try.  

*(Tip: If Secure Boot blocks you, look in your BIOS/UEFI settings to disable it.)*


## Ways to Try Linux
- **Live USB** – Boot temporarily without touching your hard drive.  
- **Virtual Machine** – Run Linux inside Windows/macOS with software like VirtualBox.  
- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** – For Windows 10/11 users who want Linux tools without replacing their OS.  


## Installing Linux Permanently
If you like what you see, you can install Linux on your computer.

- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)  
- Another PC

### Dual-Boot (For more advanced users)
If you want to install Linux alongside an existing Windows installation here are the steps to do so:

  **Warning:** Even though you are installing Linux alongside your existing Windows install, doing so likely requires you to shrink existing partitions, although uncommon, doing so always carries the risk of data loss. It is best practice to backup your data.
